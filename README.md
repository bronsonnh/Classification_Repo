# Classifiying-Employes-by-Attrition-Likelihood

Hi, thank you for visiting this repo. This is the repo for a project I conducted, looking to predict employee attrition using machine learning techniques. 

This project was aimed at using classification algorithms to predict employee attrition. I found this to be an interesting topic as a chain of events starting with the  COVID-19 pandemic has caused an upswing in employee attrition in certain industries. This has been called "The Great Resignation" by some. 

For this project, I used a dataset containing roughly 15,000 employees and features such as satisfaction level, number of active projects, average hours worked per month, time spent with the company, sales, and salary. This data was labeled, noting whether each employee had left or was still with the company. The goal of the project is to be able to use a model trained using this dataset to predict which current employees have the highest likeliehood of leaving the company. If an employee who is still is at the company is classified by the model as having left the copmany, they would be an employee at high risk of leaving, as they have characteristics similar to employees who had already lef teh company. I tested several models including Logistic Regression, K-NN, a Decision Tree, and a Random Forest Model. The Random Forest model had the strongest recall and accuracy, which were the metrics I sought to maximize.
