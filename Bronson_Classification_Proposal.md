# Classification Proposal: Employee Retention Classification

By Nicholas Bronson

## Question/Need:

I am performing contracting work on behalf of a company that is looking to improve its employee retention rates. My client currently faces impacts of Covid-19, namely what has been dubbed as “The Great Resignation.” Many companies in the US have recently been facing higher than average resignation rates. My client is facing high levels of resignation across all levels the company. High levels of employee attrition can be quite costly and come with negative externatlities including decreased morale. 

My client is seeking to implement an intervention that will incentivize employees to stay at the company, improve their future experience with the company, and enhance thier perception of their role and position in the company. This intervention would ultimately be aimed at improving employee retention. In order to do so, the company needs to first understand who is quitting and potential reasons why they are quitting in order to implement effective interventions

The company’s questions that I will seek to answer are as follows:

1) Who are the employees that are most likely to resign, and what are the qualities of these employees? 
2) What factors have the strongest influence of whether employees will stay or leave?
3) What might appropriate and effective interventions look like, and what aspects might they target? 

## Data Description: 

The data I will use for this project contains 15,000 rows, each representing an individual employee at the company. The dataset contains 10 features including satisfaction level, time spent at the company, and whether the employee had left at the time the data was captured. The target variable will be weather the employee had left. 

## Tools:

For this project, I intend to use python and packages including pandas and numpy to perform exploratory data analysis. I will use packages such as scikit learn, seaborn, and matplotlib in order to visualize the data and create a classification model. I may also use Tableau for visualization and SQLite for data manipulation and storage.

## MVP:

The Minimum Viable Product for this task would be a baseline classification model, perhaps a KNN model, that can predict whether employees are likely to leave the company by determining their classification. This will be determined based on employees who are still at the company, but would fall in the category of “left” based on features present in the dataset. Additionally, I will provide recommendations on the key qualities of employees that may resign as well as interventions to target these employees specifically.
